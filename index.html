<h1>Welcome to my Site!</h1>
<p class="box">This Github site was created as a project for SMAD 307 with Professor David Wang. You can see his site <a href="https://wang2dm.github.io/">here</a>. All code on this site is built to specifications of <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank"> W3C</a> and web standards. Please feel free to click around and explore my various content and informational pages. You might even learn something about me in the process! Hopefully one day I'll be able to create sites like some of my favorites such as <a href="https://www.espn.com/" target="_blank"> espn</a>, but until then, feel free to contact me with any inquiries.</p>

<h2>About this Site</h2>
    <p class="box">My name is Brendon Smith and I am a <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/smad/"> School of Media Arts and Design</a> major at <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/" target="_blank">James Madison University</a> from Falls Church Virginia. I first became interested in the school when my older sister attended. When Iâ€™m not busy with work from my classes, my favorite thing to do is be active and workout or play sports. I am also a member of the <a href="https://pikapp.org/" target="_blank"> Pi Kappa Phi fraternity</a> at JMU and enjoy spending time with my fellow brothers. Outside of JMU, this summer I had the opportunity to work for a moving compnay tasked with moving former Vice President Bidens home.
        <br>
        <br>
	After graduation I hope to move to either California or Colorado and start my own business helping small businesses utilize social media. If not doing this right away, I hope to gain some experience within a creative field. Perhaps with an ad agency like <a href="https://martinagency.com/" target="_blank"> The Martin Agency</a>. I also am a huge fan of traveling and would not mind working abroad for a few years were the right opportunity to arise. As of right now I am working to put myself in a position to make these goals a reality.
