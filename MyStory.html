<h2>My Resume</h2>
    <p>A page containing my resume including a link to donwload and view it. Provides the viewer with a backround of my work and educational expierence. It is also good for potential employers or others who may be intrested in my expierence</p>
<h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>This page will include things about me that are not in my resume. Where I grew up, the expierences I had that shaped who I am today. It will give the user an insight into me as a person and what events molded me. I will provide some personal stories from my time at jmu as well as growing up. It could also include stories and insight into my family.</p>
<h2>My Intrests</h2>
    <p>This section will include content about what I like to do in my free time and hobbies I enjoy. I will talk about a wide variety of my intrests from what I listen to, to favorite activitys of mine. I think this will give users a good understanding of what I am passionate about.</p>
<h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>This is where I will talk about my plans for the future. My plans post graduation, what I hope to achieve in my professional life. I will go into detail about my aspirations not only in the professional realm but overall as a person as well.</p>
<h2>A website that inspires me</h2>
    <a href="https://www.everywhereist.com/">everywhereist.com</a>
    <p>I like the simple athestic of this website. Although it is very complex and contains a lot, its simple design makes it so that it is not overwhelming to the user. The content also has a very good hierarchy, with the most important things being what you see first. The purpose of the site also passes the 5 second rule, instantly reconizable that it is a personal website with a blog and articles voicing the authors personal opinions and thoughts.</p>
